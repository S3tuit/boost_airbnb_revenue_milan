# Analysis: Boost The Probability of Success with Your AirBnB in Milan

This analysis doesnâ€™t try to predict the success of an AirBnB in Milan. There are too many factors that influence it, and it would require much more data. Probably, even the collaboration of AirbnB itself.

This analysis serves as a solid baseline to increase the probability of having success with your AirBnB in Milan.

In this repo you can find all the code I used for gathering, cleaning, analyzing the data and fitting machine learning models.
